# Bubble Sort
<strong>Language: C</strong>

Fills an unsorted array of a given length, then bubble sorts it at a given speed. 

Rendering behavior changes to be less detailed for delays below 150 ms.

Not a very difficult algorithm to implement, but actually presenting and animating everything turned out to take a few days!
